ANALYSIS REPORT

According to our analysis, if a pet is energetic, a person is most likely to be happy regardless of the other features.
It's a mixed bag of happiness if the pet isn't energetic.

As a result of the data having a correlated feature, our AI detected patterns that we didn't expect.



To correct the first mistake:
We must gather new data and ensure that the number of cat and dog owners is balanced.

To correct the second error: 
We should ensure that the features are actually the most important things we care about when it comes to happiness.
Therefore we can just remove "energetic" from the dataset and not worry about it becoming a correlated feature during training.
However, we need be more cautious to avoid biassing the other characteristics as well.



It's important to note that not every situation is this simple.
We can't just eliminate features that don't have a clear significance in some AI,
or we might need to keep features since they're the only measurable values.

The major conclusion is that there aren't always simple and flawless solutions when it comes to constructing AI systems.
It is essential that you iterate on your designs and adjust for biases wherever possible!
