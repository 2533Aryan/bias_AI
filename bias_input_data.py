'''
This file contains a database of 4 common features of dogs and cats.

We created our own dataset instead of importing one!
We chose four common features of dogs and cats: cuddly, soft, quiet, and energetic.

Our goal is to find out if people are happy with their pets.

For the data collection portion of this procedure: 
We distributed a five-question yes/no survey to 30 respondents who own one cat or one dog.

# NumPy: adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
import numpy as np



# For neural network, the results must be converted into features and labels. 
# So we can compile responses into a single long list, with each row representing one survey response.
# "Yes" is represented by 1Â while "no" is represented by 0.
